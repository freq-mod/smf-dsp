# Building

To build the software, type these commands in the source directory.

- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
- `cmake --build .`

Install following packages on Debian/LibraZiK/Mint:

- `build-essential` `git` `pkg-config` `libsdl2-dev` `libasound2-dev` `libpulse-dev` `libjack-jackd2-dev` `libuv1-dev` `libuchardet-dev` `libglib2.0-dev`

(in case JACK 1 is preferred over JACK 2, replace `libjack-jackd2-dev` with `libjack-dev`)

Immediately after building, the program is available by starting `./smf-dsp`.

## Building synthesizers

The optional synthesizers have additional requirements, and they are built only if these are present.

- **Fluidsynth**: check out the `thirdparty/fluidlite` submodule.
- **FM-OPL3 (ADLMIDI)**: check out the `thirdparty/libADLMIDI` submodule.
- **FM-OPN2 (OPNMIDI)**: check out the `thirdparty/libOPNMIDI` submodule.
- **SCC (emidi)**: check out the `thirdparty/scc` submodule.
- **MT32EMU**: check out the `thirdparty/munt` submodule.
